### Hi there 👋

I'm Briana! I love learning and helping others learn. 


- 🐳 I’m currently working at Docker, helping developers get the information they need to be successful. 
- 🌱 I’m interested in programs and projects that help people learn by providing information AND ways to validate skills.
- 📚 I believe **open source education** is the future!
- 📫 How to reach me: mention me on GitHub, or find me on LinkedIn! (If I don't know you, GitHub and context will help!)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before working at Docker, I worked GitHub. Before that, (while teaching elementary school music) I contributed over 60 videos on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel!
